iDonuts shop is making an offer that states "Buy 3 Get 1 Free." This means that if a customer asks for 4 donuts, they will pay only for 3. While if the customer asks only for 3 donuts, they will pay for 3 only. If the customer asks for 9 donuts, they will pay for 7 only.

Write a C program that helps the register to calculate the total amount that the customer should pay given the number of donuts they buying. The program should ask the user to enter the number of donuts that the customer wants to buy and the price for each donut. The tax rate is fixed to 13%. The program should print the total amount that the customer should pay rounded to the nearest cent. Hint: Use the the format specifier of double data type to print the amount rounded to the nearest cent.
